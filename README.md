## Resubmit
This is the resubmission for pp3 with code institute. The fail reason's were due to the following:  
Bug causing ships to be placed ontop of eachother  
Lack of bug fixes  
Lack of content in readme  
Did not meet pep 8 requirements,  
For this resubmission I will be creating the same game as last time, only this time with the improvements necessary to reach a passing grade.

## The Build
The first thing I did for the build was write out all the functions I thought I would need for this project and add them to run.py, I also creates a tests.py file so I could test various aspects of the project as I went along.
